Methodology & Logic:
1. Data Architecture & Processing Pipeline
Data Sources Integration:

# Nine primary datasets consolidated:
data_files = 
    'BHRGenEconIndic.csv',          # GDP, sector contributions, 
    'BHEmploybySec.csv',            # Employment by sector/gender,
    'BHEmployRates.csv',            # Employment participation rates,
    'BHTradeStats.csv',             # Import/export statistics,
    'BHUnempAge&Gender.csv',        # Unemployment demographics,
    'BHUnemployRates.csv',          # Unemployment trends,
    'ECONIndicAgricultral.csv',     # Agricultural indicators,
    'InwardFDI.csv',                # Foreign investment inflows,
    'OutwardFDI.csv'                # Bahraini investment abroad.

Data Quality & Validation Process:
Load Phase: CSV files loaded with error handling and type validation, Clean Phase: Missing values identified and handled appropriately, Transform Phase: Standardized column naming and data format conversion, Validate Phase: Data consistency checks and outlier detection, Cache Phase: Streamlit caching for optimal performance.
#Note: Primariy source of data, https://www.data.gov.bh/pages/homepage/ , is limited by rather narrow accumulation of data, many datasets were recently consolidated (2020's and onwards), while other datasets only go as far back as 2016 and a few older to the 2000's. Thus, this analysis is capped by the quanitity of data provided. 

2. Economic Analysis Framework
GDP Analysis Logic:
    # Multi-dimensional GDP analysis approach:
    # 1. Growth rate visualization over time, # 2. Sectoral composition (Oil vs Non-oil), # 3. Comparative analysis with Vision 2030 targets.

Analytical Approach:

Temporal Analysis: Tracks GDP growth patterns over multiple years, Sectoral Decomposition: Separates oil-dependent vs diversified economic activity, Comparative Benchmarking: Measures progress against Vision 2030 targets, Economic Diversification Metrics.

Diversification Index Calculation:

# Non-oil share calculation methodology
nonoil_share = (
    (merged_data['Value (Million BD)_total'] - merged_data['Value (Million BD)_oil']) / 
    merged_data['Value (Million BD)_total'] * 100
)
Vision 2030 Target Tracking:

Target: Reduce oil dependency to <20% of GDP
Current Status: 14% oil dependency (TARGET ACHIEVED)
Methodology: Continuous monitoring with visual threshold indicators

3. Advanced Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
Multi-Model Forecasting Approach
The BahrainTimeSeriesAnalysis class implements three complementary forecasting methodologies:

1. Linear Regression Projection
def linear_projection(self, ts_data):
    X = ts_data['Year'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
    y = ts_data['Value'].values
    
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    # Generate 2024-2030 projections
    future_X = self.projection_years.reshape(-1, 1)
    future_pred = model.predict(future_X)
    
    return future_pred, r2_score, mean_absolute_error

2. Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
def polynomial_projection(self, ts_data, degree=2):
    poly_model = Pipeline([
        ('poly', PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)),
        ('linear', LinearRegression())
    ])

   # Captures non-linear growth patterns
4. Exponential Smoothing
def exponential_smoothing_projection(self, ts_data):
    # Multiple model comparison:
    # - Simple exponential smoothing
    # - Linear trend exponential smoothing
    # - Best model selection based on AIC criteria

Trend Analysis Algorithm
Multi-Dimensional Trend Identification:

def identify_trend(self, ts_data, indicator_name):
    # 1. Linear trend calculation using regression slope
    # 2. Trend strength assessment via R-squared
    # 3. Volatility measurement (coefficient of variation)
    # 4. Cyclical pattern detection (peaks/valleys analysis)
    # 5. Direction classification (Increasing/Decreasing/Stable)
Statistical Metrics Generated:

Trend Direction: Increasing/Decreasing/Stable based on slope
Trend Strength: Strong/Moderate/Weak based on RÂ²
Volatility: Standard deviation relative to mean
Cyclical Patterns: Peak/valley frequency analysis
Total Change: Percentage change from start to end period

4. Trade Analysis & Export Diversification
Stacked Area Visualization Logic
# Advanced export composition analysis
export_chart.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=merged_exports['Year'],
    y=merged_exports['Value (Million BD)_nonoil'],
    fill='tozeroy',  # Fill to zero baseline
    name='Non-Oil Exports'
))
export_chart.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=merged_exports['Year'],
    y=merged_exports['Value (Million BD)_oil'] + merged_exports['Value (Million BD)_nonoil'],
    fill='tonexty',  # Stack on previous layer
    name='Oil Exports'
))
Export Diversification Assessment:

Baseline Measurement: 50% non-oil exports as balanced portfolio target
Trend Analysis: Multi-year progression toward diversification
Visual Indicators: Color-coded progress tracking

5. Employment & Labor Market Analysis
Multi-Dimensional Employment Framework
Sectoral Employment Distribution: Gender-disaggregated analysis by economic sector
Unemployment Trend Analysis: Time series of unemployment rates by demographic
Labor Force Participation: Comprehensive workforce engagement metrics
Analytical Logic:

# Gender-sector employment analysis
sector_summary = employment_data.groupby(['Sector', 'Sex'])['Recruitment'].sum().reset_index()
# Unemployment trend visualization
unemployment_rates = unemployment_data[unemployment_data['Indicator'].str.contains('Rate', na=False)]
6. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analysis
Comprehensive FDI Framework
Inward vs Outward FDI Balance:

# Net FDI position calculation
fdi_balance['Net_FDI'] = fdi_balance['Inward_FDI'] - fdi_balance['Outward_FDI']
# Sector-wise FDI trend analysis for top 5 performing sectors
top_sectors = inward_fdi[inward_fdi['Year'] == latest_year].nlargest(5, 'Value.')
Investment Flow Analysis:

Sectoral Performance: Top 5 FDI recipient sectors over time
Net Position Tracking: Balance between inward and outward investment
Trend Identification: Growth patterns and volatility assessment
7. Vision 2030 Goals Assessment Framework
Multi-Goal Progress Tracking System
Six Core Vision 2030 Goals Monitored:

Economic Diversification: <20% oil dependency ( ACHIEVED: 14%)
GDP Growth: 3-4% sustainable growth ( ON TRACK: 3.5% projected 2025)
Employment: 70% private sector employment ( ACHIEVED)
Trade Balance: Positive balance maintenance ( ACHIEVED: 4.8% surplus)
Fiscal Sustainability: Deficit reduction & non-hydrocarbon revenue increase
Infrastructure & Digital: Digital transformation capabilities enhancement
Progress Indicator Logic:

# Automated progress assessment
if "achieved" in details['outlook']:
    st.success("Target achieved or on track")
elif "Positive" in details['outlook']:
    st.info("Positive progress")
else:
    st.warning("Requires attention")
